          <h2>Students</h2>
          <p>Struggling in school can feel like you fell off a train and you're now lost in the woods.
            Instead of letting students
            fall behind further and further, we automatically deliver material that focuses
            on each student's unique foundational misunderstandings. By doing this,
            every student has the ability to reach their fullest potential.

        <div class="teacherbox">
          <h2>Teachers</h2>
          <p>A virtual classroom that feels as
            authentic as the real one. Here you can host your
            own personal courses, lessons, and practice or even use
            content from another teacher. We provide performance
            results for each student that diagnoses weak points in
            their understanding, so you can refine your instruction to
            accommodate for that.

        <div class="parentbox">
          <h2>Parents</h2>
          <p>For centuries, parents had to pry out what their
            child learned in class with the classic "How was
            school today?" Parents now have transparent access to
            see exactly what their student is working on and how well
            they are getting the material. On top of that, we also provide
            robust analytics to show your child's progress over time.
